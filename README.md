# Meshtastic

Spring 2025 <br/>

The Meshtastic workshop is a hardware-based workshop that focuses on creating a Meshtastic nodes. Meshtastic devices functions as routers, receivers, and transmitters. The devices that we are building are working on the 915 MHz frequency and send data packets on these radio waves. These devices provide AES256-CTR encryption which is the same encryption used by the government for top secret information. These nodes create a larger network that allows relaying data packets off of nodes until the target device is reached.

## Requirements:

This workshop requires a laptop and a micro usb cable for flashing the device

## Build Instructions:

The build instructions are attached as a pdf to go through the steps for the assembly and flashing of the meshtastic <br/>
